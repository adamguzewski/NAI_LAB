###-- Antecednets (Inputs):
    1) 'drivers_age' - values between 18 and 80 // How old is the customer
        Fuzzy set: low, medium, high
    2)  'population_of_city' - values between 0 and 500 (expressed in 10 000, e.g. 'population_of_city' = 150, it means
        1 500 000 in real life) // how big is the population in drivers city
        Fuzzy set: low, medium, high
    3)  'car_power' - values between 0 and 220 (kilowatt) // how much power drivers car has
        Fuzzy set: low, medium, high

###-- Consequents (Outputs):
    1) 'risk'
    Universe: How risky is our client on a scale from 0 to 100% ?
    Fuzzy Set: low, medium, high
